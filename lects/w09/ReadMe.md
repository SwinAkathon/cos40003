To apply the **no-preemption prevention solution** to the `ProductSales` program so that it calls the **lock-safe methods** within `Product` and `Order`, we can structure the code to use the methods (`adjustQuantity()`, `reserveStock()`, `fulfillOrder()`, and `cancelOrder()`) within `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor`. This approach makes the program reflect a realistic locking scenario, where the methods themselves handle the locking, encapsulating thread-safe access to shared resources.

This implementation uses **no-preemption prevention** by ensuring that threads do not hold partial resources while waiting. Each operation is lock-safe and handles consistency within the methods. This approach minimizes direct lock handling in `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor`, making the code more maintainable and reflecting real-world usage scenarios in transaction systems.

### Solution Outline:
1. Modify `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor` classes to use `adjustQuantity()`, `reserveStock()`, and `fulfillOrder()` methods rather than direct locks.
2. Remove direct `tryLock()` calls on `product.lock` and `order.lock`; instead, rely on the locking within each method.

### Updated Code

Below is the revised code for the main classes reflecting these changes.

#### `ProductAdjustment.java`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ProductAdjustment implements Runnable {
    private final Product product;
    private final Order order;

    public ProductAdjustment(Product product, Order order) {
        this.product = product;
        this.order = order;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            // Attempt to reserve stock and adjust quantity if successful
            if (product.reserveStock(10)) {  // Try reserving 10 units
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reserved stock on Product with ID " + product.getId());

                // Adjust quantity in a lock-safe way
                product.adjustQuantity(-10);
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " adjusted quantity on Product with ID " + product.getId());

                // Attempt to fulfill the order safely
                if (order.lock.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                    try {
                        order.fulfillOrder();  // Fulfills order in a lock-safe way
                        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " fulfilled Order with ID " + order.getId());
                    } finally {
                        order.lock.unlock();
                    }
                } else {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not lock Order, releasing Product stock reservation.");
                    product.adjustQuantity(10);  // Roll back if unable to fulfill order
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not reserve stock on Product with ID " + product.getId());
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### `OrderProcessor.java`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class OrderProcessor implements Runnable {
    private final Order order;
    private final Product product;

    public OrderProcessor(Order order, Product product) {
        this.order = order;
        this.product = product;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            // Attempt to fulfill the order first in a lock-safe way
            if (order.lock.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                try {
                    order.fulfillOrder();
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " fulfilled Order with ID " + order.getId());

                    // Adjust Product quantity if order is successfully fulfilled
                    if (product.reserveStock(10)) {  // Reserve stock in a lock-safe way
                        product.adjustQuantity(-10);  // Adjust the quantity safely
                        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " adjusted quantity on Product with ID " + product.getId());
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not reserve stock on Product, rolling back Order fulfillment.");
                        order.cancelOrder();  // Rollback if unable to reserve stock
                    }
                } finally {
                    order.lock.unlock();
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not lock Order for processing.");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Using Lock-Safe Methods in Product and Order**:
   - `ProductAdjustment` now calls `product.reserveStock()` and `product.adjustQuantity()`, which are lock-safe methods for modifying product quantity.
   - Similarly, `OrderProcessor` uses `order.fulfillOrder()` and `order.cancelOrder()`, which handle locking internally for safe status updates.

2. **Retry Logic with Lock Timeout**:
   - Both classes use `tryLock()` on `order.lock` with a timeout to handle cases where one thread is unable to lock `Order`. If a thread cannot obtain the necessary locks, it rolls back by releasing stock or canceling the order as appropriate.

3. **Rollback Actions**:
   - If `OrderProcessor` cannot reserve stock on `Product` after fulfilling the order, it cancels the order to ensure consistency.
   - If `ProductAdjustment` cannot fulfill the `Order` after adjusting `Product`, it re-adjusts the product stock to its previous state, preventing unintended inventory changes.

# Product and Order locks
A realistic scenario for applying `product.lock` and `order.lock` would be in an **e-commerce** or **inventory management system**, where **Product** and **Order** represent a catalog item and a customer order, respectively. Below are examples of methods within `Product` and `Order` that would need synchronization, where applying `product.lock` and `order.lock` directly would ensure thread-safe, consistent access:

### Example Scenario:

1. **Product Class (`product.lock`)**:
   - **`adjustQuantity()`**: When an order is placed or canceled, this method adjusts the inventory count of a product. Locking `product.lock` ensures that multiple threads donâ€™t modify the quantity simultaneously, preventing inventory inaccuracies.
   - **`reserveStock(int quantity)`**: Used when a customer adds an item to the cart, reserving the quantity in inventory temporarily until the order is processed. This prevents double booking of stock.

2. **Order Class (`order.lock`)**:
   - **`fulfillOrder()`**: Marks the order as "Fulfilled" and is responsible for finalizing the transaction. Locking `order.lock` ensures that only one thread updates the order status, avoiding issues with duplicate order fulfillment.
   - **`cancelOrder()`**: When a customer cancels an order, this method would roll back any reserved inventory for products in the order. Locking here ensures only one thread can cancel at a time, avoiding partial rollbacks or inconsistencies if the product quantity was already modified.

### Example Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Product {
    private final int id;
    private int quantity;
    public final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public Product(int id, int quantity) {
        this.id = id;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    // Adjust product quantity safely using product.lock
    public void adjustQuantity(int amount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            quantity += amount;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    // Reserve stock safely
    public boolean reserveStock(int amount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            if (quantity >= amount) {
                quantity -= amount;
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

public class Order {
    private final int id;
    private String status;
    public final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public Order(int id) {
        this.id = id;
        this.status = "Pending";
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getStatus() {
        return status;
    }

    // Fulfill order safely using order.lock
    public void fulfillOrder() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            if (status.equals("Pending")) {
                status = "Fulfilled";
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    // Cancel order safely
    public void cancelOrder() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            if (status.equals("Pending")) {
                status = "Canceled";
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Product Locking**: Both `adjustQuantity()` and `reserveStock()` methods use `product.lock` to ensure only one thread modifies the product quantity at a time. This is essential in preventing overselling and maintaining accurate stock levels across concurrent transactions.
   
2. **Order Locking**: The `fulfillOrder()` and `cancelOrder()` methods use `order.lock` to prevent conflicts in updating the order status. Without these locks, two threads could theoretically attempt to fulfill and cancel the same order, leading to data inconsistencies.

### Why Use Locks This Way?

This design ensures that **shared resources** (`Product` and `Order` instances) are accessed in a controlled manner:
- **Consistency**: Prevents overselling of products by synchronizing inventory modifications.
- **Thread Safety**: Eliminates race conditions when fulfilling or canceling orders, ensuring that operations on orders and products are isolated from other threads.

By applying `product.lock` and `order.lock` directly to methods that modify state, we achieve thread-safe handling of transactions in the product sales scenario.
