This change prevents deadlock by breaking the **circular wait** condition, a key factor in deadlock scenarios. The program is now deadlock-free, as threads acquire resources in a consistent order, removing the possibility of one thread holding a lock and waiting for a lock held by the other.

To implement **circular wait prevention** in this program, weâ€™ll establish a consistent ordering for locking resources to avoid a deadlock. This method involves ensuring that both `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor` acquire locks in the same order, breaking the circular dependency.

### Solution Outline:
1. **Resource Ordering**: We will assign an order to the resources:
   - For example, always lock `Product` first and then `Order`.
2. **Locking Order Consistency**: Both `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor` will lock resources in this consistent order.

### Modified Code

Below is the improved code for the relevant classes.

#### `ProductAdjustment.java`
```java
public class ProductAdjustment implements Runnable {
    private final Product product;
    private final Order order;

    public ProductAdjustment(Product product, Order order) {
        this.product = product;
        this.order = order;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Lock Product first, then Order to maintain consistent locking order
        synchronized (product) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Product with ID " + product.getId());

            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);  // Simulate work with Product resource
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " waiting to lock Order with ID " + order.getId());
            synchronized (order) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Order and completed product adjustment.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### `OrderProcessor.java`
```java
public class OrderProcessor implements Runnable {
    private final Order order;
    private final Product product;

    public OrderProcessor(Order order, Product product) {
        this.order = order;
        this.product = product;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Lock Product first, then Order to maintain consistent locking order
        synchronized (product) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Product with ID " + product.getId());

            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);  // Simulate work with Product resource
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " waiting to lock Order with ID " + order.getId());
            synchronized (order) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Order and completed order processing.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Consistent Lock Order**: Both `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor` now lock `Product` first, then `Order`, eliminating the circular wait condition.
2. **Circular Wait Prevention**: By enforcing this lock order, we prevent the circular dependency that led to deadlock, as each thread follows the same locking sequence.
