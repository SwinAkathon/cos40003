To apply **hold-and-wait prevention** to the program, we need to ensure that each thread requests and acquires **all necessary resources** at once. This approach prevents any thread from holding one resource while waiting for another, thus avoiding deadlock.

### Solution Outline:
1. **Acquire All Locks Together**: Modify the `run` methods in both `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor` to acquire all locks at once before performing any operations.
2. **Release Locks After Work**: Once a thread has completed its work, it should release all locks. This avoids partial locking, where one thread holds one lock while waiting for another.

### Modified Code

Below is the improved code for the relevant classes with hold-and-wait prevention applied.

#### `ProductAdjustment.java`
```java
public class ProductAdjustment implements Runnable {
    private final Product product;
    private final Order order;

    public ProductAdjustment(Product product, Order order) {
        this.product = product;
        this.order = order;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Acquire all necessary locks together
        synchronized (product) {
            synchronized (order) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Product with ID " + product.getId());
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Order with ID " + order.getId());

                try {
                    // Simulate work with Product and Order resources
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed product adjustment.");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### `OrderProcessor.java`
```java
public class OrderProcessor implements Runnable {
    private final Order order;
    private final Product product;

    public OrderProcessor(Order order, Product product) {
        this.order = order;
        this.product = product;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Acquire all necessary locks together
        synchronized (product) {
            synchronized (order) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Product with ID " + product.getId());
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked Order with ID " + order.getId());

                try {
                    // Simulate work with Product and Order resources
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed order processing.");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **All Locks Acquired Together**: Both `ProductAdjustment` and `OrderProcessor` now acquire locks for both `Product` and `Order` at the start of their operations. This ensures that no thread can hold one lock while waiting for the other, eliminating the hold-and-wait condition.
2. **Single Critical Section**: Since both resources are locked in a single synchronized block, each thread completes its operation on `Product` and `Order` without holding one lock and waiting for the other.

### Summary:
By acquiring all necessary resources in one go, we prevent threads from holding a resource and waiting for others. This approach eliminates deadlock by breaking the **hold-and-wait** condition.
